-Add basic validation, test this by trying to add an invalid film on page. 
:name, :url, :description

- Run specs again, the model spec for Film should be broken as it's now not valid so create a film Factory Girl to fix the broken spec for a new Film

- Clean out the http:// from URL when it is saved. write a spec then add a before_validation callback.

- Write a set of specs for the Films controller.
